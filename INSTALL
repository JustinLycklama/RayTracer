Getting this to run!

You need to install png lib, and lua5.1 for this to work.

LIBPNG: http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html

LUA: brew install lua@5.1


The makefile required some tweaking as well. It uses pkg-config, which searches for .pc files in its path.
It wasn't able to find libpng, so I tweaked it by adding '-I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib -w -lz -lpng16'
to the CPP and CXX flags. 

pkg-config is really just a tool to easily find libraries, and this line links to the inclues and libs for the package directly, so we don't need pkg-config.
